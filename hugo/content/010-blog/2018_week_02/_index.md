- Adoption is at 430+ users, 300+ projects, 70+ clusters.
- The call for papers for KubeCon Europe 2018 in Copenhagen ends 12th of January. Thanks for the many proposals. Michael Picht is orchestrating them. Please do not forget that you will have to submit your talks yourselves (you need to fill out a questionnaire, agree on the format, decide about speaker and co-speaker (max. 2) and provide bios, title and abstract).
- News flash: [Kubernetes v1.9](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/12/kubernetes-19-workloads-expanded-ecosystem.html) is out (we plan to couple its adoption with breaking changes and thereby drop the old clusters and their related problems which is still the most convenient way for us to mitigate the not yet implemented automatic updates of existing clusters).
